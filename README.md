## Code Vagabonds - Healthcare

The participants are required to use this repository as a template and create a private Github repository under their own username (Single repository per team). The following created sections in this README.md need to be duly filled, highlighting the denoted points for the solution/implementation. Please feel free to create further sub-sections in this markdown, the idea is to understand the gist of the components in a singular document.

### Project Overview
----------------------------------
As the prime focus of the time is to maintain social distancing so mass gatherings must be avoided. The stranded junta should be given shelter to avoid this.Shelter for people irrespective of religion and the wealth they possess. Just a gesture to help those who are left lamenting.Here we ensure a good public-administration relation .Food is such an aspect for which the government has already allocated funds and is distributing the buffer FCI stock in ration stops to the AAY/BPL card holders .So we need to channelize that flow and prevent any fraud in the process .The basic project objective is to provide shelter to the people who got stranded  in different parts of the country,firstly covering the worst hit areas and densely populated cities . This would lead to maintaining ‘social distancing’ and thus reduce mass gatherings which leads to rapid spread of COVID-19.As soon as the person gets the shelter,he will be provided with food (coupon system) instead of providing them the ration. 

### Solution Description
----------------------------------
1.An app that helps the stranded and homeless people in this pandemic find a shelter free of cost  .
2.This app is based on the concept of Public - Police Partnership, an entirely new concept.
3.Those who own more than a house or a  hotel/hostel/dharmashalas which are vacant as of now can register for providing shelter. A parallel portal for the police officials incharge of that area.
4.Registration would be a short process where the proof of ownership and a government ID card of the property owner shall be required alongside some basic informations which will be verified by the police
5.If someone you know is stranded in some part of the country,just give a missed call to our toll free no. ,we’ll get back within a few moments and take down the location and details of the folk.
These will be fed to a database which is accessible by both the app administrators and areal police.
6.There will be a chat box for the owners and police to interact for better interaction
The Admin Dashboard will be for the developers for purposes like complaints and feedback of the app.
