## Code Vagabonds - Healthcare

The participants are required to use this repository as a template and create a private Github repository under their own username (Single repository per team). The following created sections in this README.md need to be duly filled, highlighting the denoted points for the solution/implementation. Please feel free to create further sub-sections in this markdown, the idea is to understand the gist of the components in a singular document.

### Project Overview
----------------------------------
As there are many people left without a home due to the sudden imposition of lockdown by the government, the need of the hour is to provide them some form of relief in the form of providing them with shelter and food. At the moment, most of them are taking rest in massive gatherings in temples and mosques. This also creates a mass gathering in public spaces which must be avoided at all costs.

Shelter is an app to help those who are left lamenting. Here we ensure a good public-administration relation. The basic project objective is to provide shelter to the people who got stranded  in different parts of the country by encouraging those who own more than a house or a  hotel/hostel/dharmashalas to open up for use as a shelter to the stranded people. Such people would then be approached by police agencies, who have a knowledge about such stranded people. This would provide them the comfort of having a shed above their head. This would also lead to maintaining ‘social distancing’ and thus reduce mass gatherings which leads to rapid spread of COVID-19. After the person gets the shelter, he will be provided with food made from the allocated pmcares fund. The police will also be able to keep a track of people located in the shelters in their respective area of jurisdiction and hence help in the distribution of food rations.

### Solution Description
----------------------------------
1. An app that helps the stranded and homeless people in this pandemic find a shelter free of cost.
2. This app is based on the concept of Public - Police Partnership, an entirely new concept.
3. Those who own more than a house or a  hotel/hostel/dharmashalas which are vacant as of now can register for providing shelter. A parallel portal for the police officials incharge of that area is also provided.
4. Registration would be a short process where the proof of ownership, government ID card of the property owner, capacity and contact details shall be required which will be verified by government agencies though our admin portal and then approved to be listed.  
5. Once the property is listed, the details of the place will be displayed to the local police, who are aware of such stranded victims in their locality.
6. The police will also be able to keep a track of people located in the shelters in their respective area of jurisdiction and hence help in the distribution of food rations.
7. If someone is aware of someone being stranded in some part of the country, they can give a missed call to our toll free no. and we will get in touch with them shortly. We will then request the local police to track down that person.
8. A donation link to the pmcares website will also be placed in the homepage, for willing contributors.
